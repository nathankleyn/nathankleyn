### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nathan, and I currently work for [Intent HQ](https://www.intenthq.com/) as Director of Engineering, writing functional Scala by day and Rust by night. [I write for SitePoint about Ruby](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/nkleyn/), and [I'm writing interesting thoughts about all sorts on my blog](https://nathankleyn.com/). You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nathankleyn) and of course here on GitHub. If you want to email me the old fashioned way, you can get in touch with me at mail/at/nathankleyn.com.
